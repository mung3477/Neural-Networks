# Neural-Networks

Implementations of papers that I have read
You can run the codes by running each command.
You can install the requirements by running the following command:

```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Hopfield Network

Paper from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC346238/pdf/pnas00447-0135.pdf).
You can run the code by running the following command:

```
