Certainly. Let's break down the derivation of equation (10) step by step:

1. The starting point is equation (9), which represents the one-step update rule for the classification neurons:

    $$ c*α = g[β Σ*μ (F(−ξ*μ*α x*α + Σ*β≠α ξ*μ*β x*β + Σ_i ξ*μ*i v_i) - F(ξ*μ*α x*α + Σ*β≠α ξ*μ*β x*β + Σ*i ξ*μ_i v_i))] $$

2. The key to deriving equation (10) is to consider the limit where x_α → 0 for all α. This is represented in the paper by initializing all classification neurons to a small value ε.

3. In this limit, we can use a Taylor expansion of the function F around the point Σ*i ξ*μ_i v_i:

    F(±ξ*μ*α x*α + Σ*β≠α ξ*μ*β x*β + Σ_i ξ*μ*i v_i) ≈ F(Σ_i ξ*μ*i v_i) ± F'(Σ_i ξ*μ*i v_i)ξ*μ*α x*α

4. Substituting this expansion into equation (9):

    c*α ≈ g[β Σ*μ (F(Σ*i ξ*μ*i v_i) - F'(Σ_i ξ*μ*i v_i)ξ*μ*α x*α - F(Σ*i ξ*μ*i v_i) - F'(Σ_i ξ*μ*i v_i)ξ*μ*α x*α)]

5. The F(Σ*i ξ*μ_i v_i) terms cancel out, leaving:

    c*α ≈ g[−2β Σ*μ F'(Σ*i ξ*μ*i v_i)ξ*μ*α x*α]

6. Now, set β = 1/(2ε), where ε is the small initial value of x*α. This choice of β effectively cancels out x*α:

    c*α ≈ g[Σ*μ F'(Σ*i ξ*μ*i v_i)ξ*μ_α]

7. Finally, define f(x) = F'(x) to get equation (10):

    c*α = g[Σ*μ ξ*μ*α f(Σ*i ξ*μ_i v_i)]

This derivation shows how the dense associative memory model with a one-step update is equivalent to a feedforward neural network with one hidden layer. The function f, which is the derivative of the energy function F, becomes the activation function for the hidden layer in this equivalent network.
